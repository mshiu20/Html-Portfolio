<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, this is Maureen, this is a little get to know me.
  I graduated with a degree in Bachelors in Political Science, from The Ohio State University. 
  I also work full time at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. 
  I initially graduated with B.A. in Political science wanting to get into law school. However, I found learning about computers and coding makes life easy, even as an aspiring law student. 
  I enrolled myself in a bootcamp and I did Cybersecurity, so shout out to me, I'm also a Cybersecurity analyst.
  I created a presentation, <i>"Medicine Meets Machine"</i> this is a proposal to a targeted healthcare company that I researched, on how they can keep their data safe while still providing quality healthcare.

<p>My current job in the hospital has taught me a lot on how to work and treat people from diverse backgrounds with respect.
  I love working with people especially helping them and being able to put a smile on their faces.
  I love working in a team where we develop different tactics on how to deliver care and satisfy our patient.
